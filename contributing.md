## We Develop with Github
We use github to host the awesome list, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

This project is still a work in progress. But would love your input! 
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added new links, ensure it follows addition guidelines below.
3. If you've deleted existing links or sections, provide a reason in the PR and we can discuss.
4. Feel free to create new branches in your forked repo and make changes and experiment as you like.
5. Once everything is completed and you are satisfied with your changes in any branch of your choice, ensure all your changes are collected in your `master` or `main` branch, which should be in sync and upto date with the `main branch` of the [original repo](https://github.com/mratanusarkar/awesome-web-designs).
6. Issue that pull request!


## Addition Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure your new additions are made under the existing categories and sub-categories having similar groupings
- If it is a new subcategory, mention the same in the PR
- Make sure that your sub-catagory additions contains the following data:
  * link or name of the original website
  * a small description about the website and what is great in it (so that people can find inspiration based on requirement in their project)
  * a codepen or repo link containing code to recreate the website or some portions of the website
  * my ratting
  * tags: such as ui, ux, color, font, transition, button, card transition, effects etc etc type of tags, so that one can find relevant website based on their requirement.

Feel free to share your thoughts or ideas or suggestions on the existing codebase by opening a new issue at [issues](https://github.com/mratanusarkar/awesome-web-designs/issues), and we can start a discussion!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
