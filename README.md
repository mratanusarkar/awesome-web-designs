## Introduction

Discover beautiful and inspiring websites with **Awesome Web Designs**. This open-source project is dedicated to discovering and documenting some of the most beautiful and inspiring websites on the internet. Webpages which may be termed as "art" due to it's design, style or choice of color combinations, or Websites that showcase stunning UI and UX designs, and impressive transitions, animations or web components.

The end goal is to have a dynamic table where you can browse and filter the content by tags such as color, font, transition, and more along with code snippets and resources to recreate them.

## Features

* a codepen or repo link containing code to recreate the website or some portions of the website
* my ratting
* tags: such as ui, ux, color, font, transition, button, card transition, effects etc etc type of tags, so that one can find relevant website based on their requirement.

Along with the list of websites,
